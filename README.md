# Project2--RealInsights
For this project we sought to use API calls to fetch and return nationwide real estate data from multiple sources and then visualize that data to illustrate how property values have changed over time. The period of time we chose to on was 2012 to 2017. Our initial source of data from Kaggle.com was converted from CSV format to JSON and loaded to MongoDB. We then employed Flask API to call the housing data and display it on an interactive map of the United States using Plotly and Chloropleth. To drill down further we included a feature allowing the user to see data on the top 5 highest values in the country or inspect value change by state.
